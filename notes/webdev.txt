Web development is the creation of websites and web applications that run in a browser. It has two main areas:

1. Frontend (Client-Side)
This is everything the user sees and interacts with in the browser.

Core Technologies:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Structures content (e.g., headings, paragraphs, forms).

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styles the layout, colors, fonts, responsiveness.

JavaScript (JS): Adds interactivity (e.g., sliders, buttons, dynamic content).

Frameworks/Libraries:
React.js: Component-based library for building dynamic UIs.

Vue.js / Angular: Other modern frontend frameworks.

Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap: Utility-first or component-based CSS frameworks for fast styling.

Tools:
NPM/Yarn: Package managers.

Webpack/Vite/Parcel: Module bundlers.

Babel: Transpiler for modern JS features.

2. Backend (Server-Side)
Handles business logic, databases, and APIs.

Languages & Frameworks:
Node.js (JavaScript runtime) + Express.js

Python (with Flask or Django)

PHP, Java (Spring Boot), Ruby on Rails

Databases:
Relational (SQL): MySQL, PostgreSQL

NoSQL: MongoDB, Firebase

Core Concepts:
APIs (REST, GraphQL): Interfaces for client-server communication.

Authentication & Authorization: User login, session management (OAuth, JWT).

MVC Pattern: Separates Model, View, and Controller layers for cleaner code.

3. Fullstack Development
Combining frontend + backend. Example: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

4. DevOps & Deployment
Version Control: Git, GitHub

CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Netlify, Vercel

Hosting: Firebase, AWS, Heroku, Render

5. Modern Practices
Responsive Design: Mobile-first, using media queries and flexible layouts.

Single Page Applications (SPA): Dynamic navigation without reloading.

Progressive Web Apps (PWA): Offline-capable web apps.

Web Security: HTTPS, CORS, Content Security Policy (CSP), XSS/CSRF prevention.
